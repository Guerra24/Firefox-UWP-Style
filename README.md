# Firefox UWP Style

This is a very visually simple theme that follows UWP styling with the accent color and gray-on-black elements, combines both while remaining original.

## Install

This theme only supports the default Dark mode and Compact UI, selection of other type [in the customization page](https://puu.sh/AORte/1e2ae0255e.png) is disabled.

Select the branch that targets your version of Firefox.

- master > Nightly
- firefox-61 > Firefox 61 & 62.
- firefox-58 > Firefox 58, 59 & 60.

The firefox-58 branch has an incomplete theme, I have plans for back-porting features only to FF60 so I might end creating a ff60 branch.

### With Git

Go into your Firefox profile folder and clone the repo:
`git clone -b <branch> https://github.com/Guerra24/Firefox-UWP-Style.git chrome`

Replace `<branch>` with the one that targets your version of Firefox.

Now restart Firefox and the theme will be enabled.

### Without Git

Download the code of the branch as ZIP, copy the content inside the folder(where the userChrome.css file is located) into your chrome folder.

Now restart Firefox and the theme will be enabled.

## Tweaks

Check userChrome.css for customizable variables or restore elements.
